        <i>Pure Whitespace</i> is one of the incarnations of my website. It's a
        website theme that literally has nothing but whitespace to frame things.
        No borders, no colour contrasts, nothing. (Okay, so I cheat a bit and
        have the buttons on the bottom turn slightly gray once you hover over them,
        but by <i>default</i> nothing is coloured or bordered.)
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the reasons I decided to use a layout like this one is that I can
        never decide on a fixed identity for myself, and therefore a fixed design
        representing what I am. It's in constant limbo, so I thought I'd make a
        not-really-a-design to reflect that.
    </p>

    <p>
        Basically, I'm lazy. And I barely ever maintain my website as it is currently,
        so doing a design with, well, minimal friction might give me more of a reason
        to do so. Besides, it's not like all my web designs aren't pretty much
        entirely whitespace-based anyway. (Not to mention this design is
        so responsive it hurts.)
